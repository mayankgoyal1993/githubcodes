While establishing a refuge for Catholics, who faced increasing persecution in Anglican England, the Calverts were also interested in creating profitable estates.
To this end, and to avoid trouble with the British government, they also encouraged Protestant immigration.
Maryland's royal charter had a mixture of feudal and modern elements.
On the one hand the Calvert family had the power to create manorial estates.
On the other, they could only make laws with the consent of freemen (property holders).
They found that in order to attract settlers — and make a profit from their holdings — they had to offer people farms, not just tenancy on manorial estates.
The number of independent farms grew in consequence.
Their owners demanded a voice in the affairs of the colony.
Maryland's first legislature met in 1635.
